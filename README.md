        if (user === 'admin') unsetCookie('user')
        if (!user)
            setCookie('user', 'saltyaom', {
                httpOnly: true
            })

```

### setCookie

setCookie: (
    name: string,
    value: string,
    options?: CookieSerializeOptions
) => void
```

### removeCookie
A function to remove cookie
```typescript
removeCookie: (name: string) => void
```

### unsignCookie
Unsign cookie
```typescript
unsignCookie: (name: string) => void
```

### Serialize Options
Serialize option is based on [cookie package](https://npmjs.com/package/cookie)
```typescript
export interface CookieSerializeOptions {
    /**
     * Specifies the value for the {@link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.2.3|Domain Set-Cookie attribute}. By default, no

     * the current domain.

    /**
     * Specifies a function that will be used to encode a cookie's value. Since
     * value of a cookie has a limited character set (and must be a simple
     * string), this function can be used to encode a value into a string suited
     * for a cookie's value.
     *
     * The default function is the global `encodeURIComponent`, which will
     * encode a JavaScript string into UTF-8 byte sequences and then URL-encode
     * any that fall outside of the cookie range.

     * it on a condition like exiting a web browser application.

     * default, the `HttpOnly` attribute is not set.

## Caveat
As the current state of Bun (0.1.4), there's no current way to set multiple cookie at once as Bun doesn't support setting multiple headers with same name which is required for setting multiple cookie in one response.
